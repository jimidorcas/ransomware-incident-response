# 💥 Ransomware Incident Response Scenario (DarkVault Case Study)

## 📘 Overview
This project simulates a real-world **ransomware attack** to demonstrate the complete **incident response lifecycle** - from detection and containment to recovery and post-incident review.  
It aligns with the **NIST Incident Response Framework** and showcases structured technical and communication practices used in real security operations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Demonstrate a hands-on understanding of ransomware incident response.  
- Illustrate communication workflows between technical and executive teams.  
- Document containment, eradication, and recovery strategies.  
- Present actionable lessons learned and preventive measures.
