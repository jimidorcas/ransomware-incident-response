# 💥 Ransomware Incident Response Scenario

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a simulated **ransomware incident response case study**, illustrating how an organisation can detect, contain, and recover from a ransomware attack.  
It follows industry best practices and aligns with the **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle** — covering Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Demonstrate structured incident response under pressure.  
- Document technical and non-technical workflows during a ransomware event.  
- Show effective communication between security, IT, and executive teams.  
- Provide actionable post-incident recommendations to prevent recurrence.
